                        is the highest among the 4 areas racking almost 700 Megawatts (MW) of energy. Prior to covid
                        lockdowns, construction
                        takes the most energy consumption at 400 MW of power.

                    In conclusion, solar energy may be a reliable energy source depending on the country
                    in SouthEast Asia. An in-depth study was conducted on Singapore which showed other alternatives
                    to solar energy yielded greater output in electricity generation capacity, therefore,
                    solar energy may not be the best renewable energy source in Singapore. As compared to Vietnam,
                    it can be observed that Vietnam was able to produce the highest energy capacity using solar
                    compared to other countries making solar energy adoption the best in Vietnam out of the other
                    Southeast Asian countries.
